# Nonverbal predication [label](nonverbal)
[src](gildea2018reconstructing[366]) distinguishes two main formal types of nonverbal predication in Cariban languages: juxtaposition and copular constructions.

* juxtaposed NP + ADV or NP + LOC is found in Arara, Ikpeng, Ye'kwana, Wayana, and Apalaí
* for PC:
    * Nsubj + Npred: nominal (juxtaposition) predication. Limited in functional domains.
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Adverbial (adverbs/postpositional phrases). Fairly unlimited.
* Innovations:
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Npred (S&M 2009)
    * Nsubj + Adverbial

## Observations

### Patterns
[todo](turn this into running text w/ examples)

* "existential particles" (*mëtë*, *mïntë*, *entë*, *ijtë*)
    * etymologically locatives, used for existential function. they **can** co-occur with the existential negative [mp](pirare-neg-exist?nt)
    * also occur in locative function
    * also combine with postpositional locatives, though more often not part of the clause? [exref](convfemgrme-157), [exref](convfemgrme-99)
* the copula...
    * almost always occurs with adverbs
        * counterexamples
        * not when negated
    * can occur with locatives and existential particles
        * fairly solid pattern of copula serving as a location for past marking existential function: compare mostly past [exref](ex-main-aff-part-cop-nsubj) with nonpast [exref](ex-main-aff-part-nsubj)
        * however, no such pattern with locatives: copula [exref](loc-main-aff-part-cop-nsubj) and no copula [exref](loc-main-aff-part-nsubj) show no salient distribution
    * almost never occurs with nouns
        * only counterexample: [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> [gl](cop) with 'sick' [exref](temp-main-q-npred-cop); can occur without [gl](cop), too [exref](temp-main-aff-npred-cop)
    * does not combine with [mp](pirare-neg-exist)
        * one counterexample with [gl](part)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> + [mp](pirare-neg-exist?nt) + [gl](cop) + [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> is with a concessive [exref](ex-main-neg-part-pirare-cop-nsubj) [todo](@spike: I forgot, what was your analysis for this particular example?)
        * it does occur with [mp](pinire-neg), though [exref](loc-main-neg-nsubj-cop-pinire-part), [exref](temp-main-neg-advpred-cop-pinire-nsubj) [todo](@spike: what do you think of the analysis that the copular form is synchronically deverbal in all of these examples, licensing the nominal negator?)
    * is always present in subordinate clauses (*chi-yawë* 'when', *chi-pëke* 'because') [todo](@spike: would you analyze these subordinate clauses as having a copula? if  yes, that would constitute a small but solid difference between main and subordinate clauses, right?)
        * even with nominal predicates: [exref](cat-sub-aff-npred-nsubj-cop), [exref](temp-sub-aff-npred-nsubj-cop)
        * one example of negation, occurs on additional copula [exref](loc-sub-neg-locpred-cop-neg-nsubj)
        * one example of *chi chipokono* [exref](convamgu-101)
* several negation strategies:
    * [mp](jra-neg) for adverbs and on nouns in the existential [mp](pirare-neg-exist?nt) [gl](np~subj~)[mp](jra-neg?nt) construction [exref](ex-main-neg-pirare-nsubj-jra)
    * [mp](pinire-neg) for nominal predicates and ones with locative particles
    * [mp](pirare-neg-exist) for existential predicates
        * also for identification? [exref](id-main-neg-npred-pirare)
    * [mp](janeg?nt) or [mp](jnarineg?nt) on the copula 
* order is fairly flexible; potentially rigid [gl](adv)~[gl](pred)~ [gl](np~subj~) [gl](cop), though negated counterexample [exref](histyarirdi-249)
* unclear role of [mp](maniki-rel-anim) in [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> + [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> construction
* construction with two copulas *chi wejsapë*? [exref](convhistfamsjm-92), [exref](convhistfamsjm-59), [exref](histgrme-17), [exref](histgrme-107) [todo](ask natalia)

### Categorization issues
* possessives vs properties can be hard to distinguish ('footed', etc.)
* locative predicates are teeming with "existential" particles: largely went by 'estar' vs 'haber' in translation, with the exception of [exref](convcosnoind-48)
* [exref](poss-main-neg-locpred-nsubj) [todo](@spike: was this the analysis you suggested?)
