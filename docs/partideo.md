# Particles, ideophones and interjections [label](partideo)

* [src](koehn1986apalai[111]) on Apalaí: "Particles follow words of any class other than the ideophone, and never occur as free forms or in isolation."

## Particles
Three kinds of particles elsewhere in the family:

1. second position (modals, focus)
1. phrasal (focus)
1. clause boundary 

* prosodic effects?

[todo](see Hoff 1968 on second position particles ["sentence-level meanings"])

## Ideophones
* a construction with [mp](nwa-thus)?

[ex](ctorosq-37)
[ex](histyarirdi-142)

## Interjections
* can occur in isolation
