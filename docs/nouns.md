### Root suppletion in nominal possession [label](sec:irregnouns)
* 'father':
    * 1 *papa*
    * 2 _ë-më_ / _o-mo_ / _ë-mo_ (?)
    * 3 _i-mu_
    * NP _y-ïmï_
* often suppletive in Cariban languages: [todo](search for inflected forms of these)
    * 'arrow'
    * 'house'
    * 'poop'
    * 'mother'
    * 'hammock string'

## Pronouns [label](sec:pronouns)
The personal pronouns of [lg](yab) are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns).
The system shows the usual Cariban inclusive/exclusive ([gl](1+2) and [gl](1+3)) distinction, though the 1+2 pronoun [mp](ejne-1-2pro?nt) does not have the /k/ found elsewhere in the family.
There are plural forms of the second and third person pronouns, which are composed of the respective singular form and the plural marker [mp](kontomopl?nt) for second, _-santomo_ for third person.
An alternative strategy for pluralizing [mp](tewi-3pro?nt) is by using [mp](jnepl).
This results in [f](tewi-jne-3pro-pl?nt), which usually simply becomes [f](ta-jne-3pro-pl?nt).
Singular speech act participant pronouns can procliticize to nouns (see [ref](sec:nounphrase)), verbs (see [ref](simpleverb)) and postpositions (see [ref](sec:postp-phrase)).

[table](pronouns)

The third person demonstrative pronouns or articles are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns3). [todo](is there a 4‑way distinction? [cf. Ye’kwana?])
None of them have shortened and phonologically bound counterparts. [todo](is there a më= from mërë?)

[table](pronouns3)

* nominal interrogative pronouns: [todo](are there examples of _ëjkë_ 'which?')
    * [mp](aniki-who) ([gl](pl) with _-santomo_)
    * [mp](ati-what) (no [gl](pl))

## Nominal inflection [label](sec:nouninfl)
Nouns in Yawarana may bear suffixes marking their possession status ([ref](sec:nounposssuf)), number ([ref](sec:nominalnumber)), and nominal past tense ([ref](sec:nominaltense)).
Possessed nouns can carry second and third person prefixes, as well as the linker [mp](ylk?nt) ([ref](sec:nominalperson)). [todo](nominal inflectional classes defined by prefixes & suffixes)

### Suffixes for possessed and non-possessed nouns [label](sec:nounposssuf)
In the possession construction in Yawarana, the possessor noun occurs immediately preceding the possessed noun, which is the head of the possession phrase. [todo](crossref to phrase structure)
Alternatively, the possessor can appear as a prefix on the possessed noun.
The possessor noun is never marked (for instance, with genitive case), but the possessed noun (the head) is often marked for being possessed by a suffix; an unambiguous label for this counterpart of the genitive is pertensive [psrc](dixon2010basic).
The choice of suffix is lexically conditioned; while most nouns take [mp](rupert), some take [mp](tipert?nt).
Unpossessed nouns generally are unmarked, but some 15 nouns [todo](add list of -të nouns) bear the suffix [mp](tenpert) when they appear without a possessor. 

Examples [exref](onlypossessed?end=unsuffixednouns) illustrate the possible patterns of markedness for nouns when possessed and unpossessed.
The vast majority of nouns in our corpus are unmarked when unpossessed, but when possessed the suffix [mp](rupert) occurs [exref](onlypossessed).
A handful of nouns is marked with [mp](rupert?nt)/[mp](tipert) when possessed and with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](diffpossessed).
Another handful is unmarked when possessed and marked with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](suffunpossessed).
The fourth logical category, where neither possession or non-possession is marked, contains very few members (only one attested so far).
For these nouns, the difference is marked only by the presence or absence of a possessive prefix or free-form possessor [exref](unsuffixednouns).
[todo](this data should live in the dataset and only be referenced here)
[manex](onlypossessed)
[manex](diffpossessed)
[manex](suffunpossessed)
[manex](unsuffixednouns)

### Nominal number [label](sec:nominalnumber)
The suffix [mp](tomopl?nt) ([m](tompl?nt), [m](tonpl?nt)) occurs on both possessed and unpossessed nouns [exref](tomonouns).
[ex](conv1stenc-123,histpajirdi-131?example_id=tomonouns)

### Nominal tense [label](sec:nominaltense)
TBD: Describe [mp](jpepst).

### Inflectional prefixes [label](sec:nominalperson)
There are three inflectional prefixal morphemes on nouns ([ref](tab:possprefixes)); only two of them are possessive prefixes, the third being the linker.
Prefix allomorphy is mainly conditioned by the initial segment of the noun root.

[table](possprefixes)

Second person [mp](a2?nt) only occurs on a small number of nouns, all of them kinship terms ([ref](tab:a2)).
With other nouns (and for all first and first person inclusive possessors), a pronominal form is used (see [ref](sec:nounphrase)).
None of the stems in [ref](tab:a2) is attested with a pronominal second person possessor.

[table](a2)

The third person prefix has the allomorphs [m](i31?nt) and [m](t3?nt):
[ex](convfemgrme-304)
[ex](ctowaru-52)

The linking prefix [mp](ylk?nt) only occurs on V-initial nouns.
It marks them as being preceded by their possessor [exref](convcosnoind-126).
C-initial (and *i*-initial) nouns do not show a prefix in this context [exref](no-y).
This pattern is shared by postpositions (see [ref](postp)).

[ex](convcosnoind-126)
[ex](convamgu-246,convfemgrme-48?example_id=no-y)

## The noun phrase [label](sec:nounphrase)
A constituent we call the noun phrase is identifiable in the genitive construction in which one noun (or pronoun) possesses another noun.
For instance, [wf](pana-ear-pert) in [exref](convfemgrme-48) is possessed by [wf](muku-child).
The possessor obligatorily precedes the possessum, the two parts of the constituent only being interruptible by certain particles [exref](histyarirdi-276).
Possessor SAP pronouns can occur as proclitics [exref](n-clitics).
On V-initial nouns, the linker [mp](ylk?nt) appears in the genitive construction.

[ex](convfemgrme-48)
[ex](histyarirdi-276)
[ex](histyarirdi-893,convamgu-272?example_id=n-clitics)

[ex](convrisamaj-28)
[ex](ctorat-46)
[ex](histyarirdi-437)
[ex](desccasmaj-38)
[ex](histpajirdi-270)
[ex](convfemgrme-60)
[ex](ctorat-19?example_id=lastex)
[ex](convfemgrme-260)
[ex](histyarirdi-893)
[ex](histgrme-29)
[ex](histpajirdi-237)

The linker also occurs with (pro-)nominal possessors:
[ex](convcosnoind-52)
