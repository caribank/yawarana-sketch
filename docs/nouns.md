* 'father':
    * 1 *papa*
    * 2 _ëmë_ / _omo_ / _ëmo_ (?)
    * 3 _imu_
    * NP _yïmï_
* other candidates:

    * 'house'
    * 'poop'
    * 'mother'
    * 'hammock string'

## Pronouns [label](sec:pronouns)
The personal pronouns of [lg](yab) are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns).
The system shows the usual Cariban inclusive/exclusive ([gl](1+2) and [gl](1+3)) distinction, though the 1+2 pronoun [mp](ejne-1-2pro?nt) does not have the /k/ found elsewhere in the family.
There are plural forms of the second and third person pronouns, which are composed of the respective singular form and the plural marker [mp](kontomopl?nt) for second, _-santomo_ for third person.
There is also a third person plural form [wf](tajne-3-pl?nt), which looks like it may etymologically be composed of the pronoun [mp](tewi-3pro?nt) and the plural marker [mp](jnepl?nt).
The first, first inclusive, and second person pronouns can procliticize to nouns (see [ref](sec:nounphrase)), verbs (see [ref](simpleverb)) and postpositions (see [ref](sec:postp-phrase)).

[table](pronouns)

The third person demonstrative pronouns or articles are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns3). [todo](is there a 4‑way distinction? [cf. Ye’kwana?])
None of them have shortened and phonologically bound counterparts. [todo](is there a më= from mërë?)
[todo](what is the distribution of plural markers in pronouns?)

[table](pronouns3)

* nominal interrogative pronouns: [todo](are there examples of _ëjkë_ 'which?')
    * [mp](aniki-who) (with _-santomo_)
    * [mp](ati-what) (no plural)

## Nominal inflection [label](sec:nouninfl)
Nouns in Yawarana may bear suffixes marking their possession status ([ref](sec:nounposssuf)), number ([ref](sec:nominalnumber)), and nominal past tense ([ref](sec:nominaltense)).
Possessed nouns may bear a person prefix, or the linker [mp](ylk?nt) ([ref](sec:nominalperson)). [todo](nominal inflectional classes defined by prefixes & suffixes)

### Suffixes for possessed and non-possessed nouns [label](sec:nounposssuf)
In the possession construction in Yawarana, the possessor noun occurs immediately preceding the possessed noun, which is the head of the possession phrase. [todo](crossref to phrase structure)
Alternatively, the possessor can appear as a prefix on the possessed noun.
The possessor noun is never marked (for instance, with genitive case), but the possessed noun (the head) is often marked for being possessed by a suffix; an unambiguous label for this counterpart of the genitive is pertensive [psrc](dixon2010basic).
The choice of suffix is lexically conditioned; while most nouns take [mp](rupert), some take [mp](tipert?nt).
Unpossessed nouns generally are unmarked, but some 15 nouns [todo](add list of -të nouns) bear the suffix [mp](tenpert) when they appear without a possessor. 

Examples [exref](onlypossessed?end=unsuffixednouns) illustrate the possible patterns of markedness for nouns when possessed and unpossessed.
The vast majority of nouns in our corpus are unmarked when unpossessed, but when possessed the suffix [mp](rupert) occurs [exref](onlypossessed).
A handful of nouns is marked with [mp](rupert?nt)/[mp](tipert) when possessed and with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](diffpossessed).
Another handful is unmarked when possessed and marked with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](suffunpossessed).
The fourth logical category, where neither possession or non-possession is marked, contains very few members (only one attested so far).
For these nouns, the difference is marked only by the presence or absence of a possessive prefix or free-form possessor [exref](unsuffixednouns).
[todo](this data should be in the dataset and referenced here)
[manex](onlypossessed)
[manex](diffpossessed)
[manex](suffunpossessed)
[manex](unsuffixednouns)

### Nominal number [label](sec:nominalnumber)
The suffix [mp](tomopl?nt) ([m](tompl?nt), [m](tonpl?nt)) occurs on both possessed and unpossessed nouns [exref](tomonouns).
[ex](conv1stenc-123,histpajirdi-131?example_id=tomonouns)

### Nominal tense [label](sec:nominaltense)
TBD: Describe [mp](jpepst).

### Inflectional prefixes [label](sec:nominalperson)
There are three inflectional prefixal morphemes on nouns ([ref](tab:possprefixes)).
Prefix allomorphy is mainly conditioned by the initial segment of the noun root.

[table](possprefixes)

Second person [mp](a2?nt) only occurs on a small number of nouns, all of them kinship terms ([ref](tab:a2)).
With other nouns, a second person pronoun is used; for first person and first person inclusive, a pronoun is used for all nouns (see [ref](sec:nounphrase)).

[table](a2)

The third person prefix has the allomorphs [m](i31?nt) and [m](it3?nt):
[ex](convfemgrme-304)
[ex](ctowaru-52)

Finally, V-initial nouns show a linking prefix [mp](ylk?nt) when preceded by their possessor [exref](convcosnoind-126).
It is shared by postpositions (see [ref](postp)).
C-initial (and *i*-initial) nouns do not show a prefix in this context [exref](no-y).

[ex](convcosnoind-126)
[ex](convamgu-246,convfemgrme-48?example_id=no-y)

## Nominal Derivational Morphology [label](sec:nounderiv)
* V → N
    * [mp](rinmlz?translation=action NMLZ) [todo](this is potentially an agent nominalizer, too)
    * [mp](jpenmlz) 
        * also ‘[gl](PST.ABS.nmlz)’ [todo](add convsuenmaj-47)
    * [mp](neinf) or ‘generic action nominalizer’ [todo](this probably only occurs on intransitive verbs)
        * _wënkej-në_ from transitive _wënkepï_ 'forget'
    * [mp](ninmlz) [todo](see ctoyucairdi-4, descokigrme-53 for predicative use)
    * [mp](nnmlzpre?nt)V[mp](rinmlz?nt) only with [mp](yeme-eat-fruits-eggs-soup)
    * [mp](sapenmlz) (contrast with [mp](jpenmlz)) 
    * [mp](toponmlz)
    * [mp](pininmlz) [todo](only found with -se-mï, not attested as nominalizer)

* What about [mp](jpenmlz) on [gl](ad) forms [exref](histyarirdi-592)? Does it derive a noun?
