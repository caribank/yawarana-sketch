## Pronouns [label](sec:pronouns)
The personal pronouns of [lg](yab) are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns).
The system shows the usual Cariban inclusive/exclusive ([gl](1+2) and [gl](1+3)) distinction, though the 1+2 pronoun [mp](ejne-1-2pro?nt) does not have the /k/ found elsewhere in the family.
It is likely a reflex of an old copula + infinitive *\*eti-në*. [todo](do we have parallel cases elsewhere?)
Regarding plural marking, it should be noted that [mp](kontomopl?nt), which appears on the second person plural pronoun, is usually restricted to verbs, while *-santomo* is only found with third person pronouns and demonstratives. [todo](tajne) [todo](combinations of tomo and -jne?)

[table](pronouns)

Reduced forms of the first and second person pronouns occur as proclitics/prefixes[todo](proclitics or prefixes?) attaching to nouns to indicate possessor (see [ref](sec:nominalperson)), attached to verbs to indicate the A or P argument (see [ref](verbinfl)), or attached to postpositions to indicate the argument of the postposition (see [ref](sec:postinfl)).
The occurrence of bound [mp](u1) on members of all three parts of speech is illustrated in [exref](1marking); [exref](2marking) illustrates the same distribution for [mp](me2).
[ex](histyarirdi-723,convrisamaj-46?example_id=1marking)
[ex](histyarirdi-160,histpajirdi-114,ctovarmafl-443?example_id=2marking)

The third person demonstrative pronouns or articles are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns3). [todo](is there a 4‑way distinction? [cf. Ye’kwana?])
None of them have shortened and phonologically bound counterparts.

* nominal interrogative pronouns: [todo](Are there plural forms of any of these?) [todo](no examples of _ëjkë_ 'which?')
    * [mp](aniki-who) (with _-santomo_)
    * [mp](ati-what) (no plural)

## Nominal inflection [label](sec:nouninfl)
Nouns in Yawarana may bear suffixes marking their possession status ([ref](sec:nounposssuf)), number ([ref](sec:nominalnumber)), and nominal past tense ([ref](sec:nominaltense)).
Possessed nouns may bear a person prefix, or the linker [mp](ylk?nt) ([ref](sec:nominalperson)). [todo](noun classes re: possession)

### Suffixes for possessed and non-possessed nouns [label](sec:nounposssuf)
In the possession construction in Yawarana, the possessor noun occurs immediately preceding the possessed noun, which is the head of the possession phrase. [todo](crossref to phrase structure)
Alternatively, the possessor can appear as a prefix on the possessed noun.
The possessor noun is never marked (for instance, with genitive case), but the possessed noun (the head) is often marked for being possessed by a suffix; an unambiguous label for this counterpart of the genitive is pertensive [psrc](dixon2010basic).
The choice of suffix is lexically conditioned; while most nouns take [mp](rupert), some take [mp](tipert?nt).
Unpossessed nouns generally are unmarked, but some 15 nouns [todo](which? list nouns) bear the suffix [mp](tenpert) when they appear without a possessor. 

Examples [exref](onlypossessed?end=unsuffixednouns) illustrate the possible patterns of markedness for nouns when possessed and unpossessed.
The vast majority of nouns in our corpus are unmarked when unpossessed, but when possessed the suffix [mp](rupert) occurs [exref](onlypossessed).
A handful of nouns [todo](i.e., the 15?) is marked with [mp](rupert?nt)/[mp](tipert) when possessed and with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](diffpossessed).
Another handful is unmarked when possessed and marked with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](suffunpossessed).
The fourth logical category, where neither possession or non-possession is marked, contains very few members (only one attested so far).
For these nouns, the difference is marked only by the presence or absence of a possessive prefix or free-form possessor [exref](unsuffixednouns).
[manex](onlypossessed)
[manex](diffpossessed)
[manex](suffunpossessed)
[manex](unsuffixednouns)

### Nominal number [label](sec:nominalnumber)
There are several pluralization strategies for nouns.
One is the suffix [mp](tomopl?nt) ([m](tompl?nt), [m](tonpl?nt)), which occurs on both possessed and unpossessed nouns [exref](tomonouns).
[ex](conv1stenc-123,histpajirdi-131?example_id=tomonouns)
It can be combined with the plural particle [mp](jnepl?nt) [exref](histyarirdi-944); this particle can also be the only exponent of plural [exref](ctorat-40).
[ex](histyarirdi-944)
[ex](ctorat-40)

There is also the particle [mp](kontomopl?nt), which marks plurality of the possessor [exref](histyarirdi-539).
Etymologically, it consists of an earlier \*_komo_ suffixed with [mp](tomopl).
[ex](histyarirdi-539)

In many nouns, old plural markers have become lexicalized, like in [mp](wiriyamo-woman) or [mp](waraijtokomo-man), which show former \*_-yamë_ and \*_komo_.

### Nominal tense [label](sec:nominaltense)
* [mp](jpepst)

### Argument prefixes [label](sec:nominalperson)
Person prefixes on nouns are conditioned by the initial segment ([ref](tab:possprefixes)).
C-initial nouns take [m](i31), and first and second person are bare [m](u1) and [m](me2).
On V-initial nouns, third person is marked with [m](it3), and the first and second person prefixes combine with the linker [mp](ylk?nt).
Some examples are shown in [exref](convrisamaj-28?end=lastex).

[table](possprefixes)

[ex](convrisamaj-28)
[ex](ctorat-46)
[ex](ctorat-19?example_id=lastex)
The linker also occurs with (pro-)nominal possessors:
[ex](convcosnoind-52)
[ex](convcosnoind-126)
There are some nouns [todo](presumably kinship terms) that preserve the old second person [mp](a2) ([ref](tab:oldpossprefixes)).[todo](find more examples of these)
