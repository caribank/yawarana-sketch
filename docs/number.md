# Number
There are several pluralization strategies for nouns, the only inflectional one using the suffix [mp](tomopl?nt).
It can be combined with the plural particle [mp](jnepl?nt) [exref](histyarirdi-944); this particle can also be the only exponent of plural [exref](ctorat-40).
[ex](histyarirdi-944)
[ex](ctorat-40)

There is also the particle [mp](kontomopl?nt), which marks plurality of the possessor [exref](histyarirdi-539).
Etymologically, it consists of an earlier \*_komo_ suffixed with [mp](tomopl).
[ex](histyarirdi-539)

In many nouns, old plural markers have become lexicalized, like in [mp](wiriyamo-woman) or [mp](waraijtokomo-man), which show former \*_-yamÃ«_ and \*_komo_.
