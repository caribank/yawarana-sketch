# Parts of speech in Yawarana [label](POS)
TBD: Introduction

## Distinguishing parts of speech
* [src](koehn1986apalai[111]) on Apalaí: "Particles follow words of any class other than the ideophone, and never occur as free forms or in isolation."

### Verbs
TBD

### Nouns
TBD

### Adverbs
* copredicative function
* no person inflection
* deriving aderbs: [mp](keprop) [todo](is -ke negated with -jra only when on noun roots?)

### Postpositions
TBD

## Shared morphology [label](sec:shared)
* third person prefixes & linker are (partially) shared between nouns and postpositions
* [mp](jpepst) on nouns, pronouns & verbs

## Pronominal clitics [label](sec:clitics)
[todo](expand this section)
Transitive and verbs, nouns, and postpositions share preposed [gl](sap) person markers.
The occurrence of bound first person [mp](u1?nt)= on members of all four parts of speech is illustrated in [exref](1marking); [exref](2marking) illustrates the same distribution for second person [mp](me2?nt)=.
The [gl](1+2) form [mp](ej12?nt)= is very rare compared to the first and second person forms.

[ex](histyarirdi-723,descmensgrme-78,convrisamaj-46?example_id=1marking)
[ex](histyarirdi-894,histyarirdi-160,histpajirdi-114,ctovarmafl-443?example_id=2marking)

When occurring on nouns and adpositions, these elements behave identically to a free pronoun by triggering the linker [mp](ylk?nt).
An alternative analysis in which the person markers are prefixes would require the *y* occurring on nouns and postpositions to be part of the prefix, so e.g. _më-_ / \_C, _mëy-_ / \_V.
However, no such *y* occurs on verbs [exref](nolinker).
Such an analysis would therefore need to postulate that there are phonologically conditioned allomorphs on nouns and postpositions, but not on verbs.
An analysis as cliticized pronominal forms does not face that issue, since the absence of *y* on verbs is expected by the absence of a linker on verbs.

[ex](convhistfamsjm-15,convfemgrme-232?example_id=nolinker)

Other applicable criteria point to a clitic analysis, too ([ref](tab:clitic-criteria)).

Interestingly, second person is much more frequently expressed by a bound form ([ref](tab:cliticity)).

## Derivation and productivity
* productive class-changing process w/ lexically conditioned suffixes
* semantic variation & non-compositional meanings
* some constructions simply need a different word class, no meaning change per se
