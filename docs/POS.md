# Parts of speech in Yawarana [label](POS)

## Distinguishing parts of speech

### Adverbs
* copredicative function
* no person inflection [todo](except some deverbalized ones?)
* deriving aderbs: [mp](keprop) [todo](-ke is negated with -jra only when on noun roots?)

## Shared morphology
* shared prefixes between nouns and postpositions
* shared clitics (?) with verbs

There are person indices shared between verbs one the one, and nouns and postpositions on the other hand:

* [mp](u1)
* [mp](me2)
* ([mp](ej12))

[mp](ta-3) is only found in verbs, while [mp](i3) and [mp](ylk)[^1] are only found on nouns and postpositions.
All shared morphemes are likely recent innovations; there is no original inflectional morphology on verbs.
Even within this shared set, nouns and postpositions behave differently from verbs.

[^1]: [mp](ylk) is found in fossilized form on transitive verbs.

[table](cliteria)

## Derivation and productivity

* changing word classes
* semantic variation & non-compositional meanings
* productive class-changing process w/ lexically conditioned suffixes
* some constructions need a different word class, no meaning change per se
