# Parts of speech in Yawarana [label](POS)

## Distinguishing parts of speech

### Adverbs
* copredicative function
* no person inflection
* deriving aderbs: [mp](keprop) [todo](is -ke negated with -jra only when on noun roots?)

### Postpositions
* [src](koehn1986apalai[111]) on ApalaÃ­: "Particles follow words of any class other than the ideophone, and never occur as free forms or in isolation."

## Shared morphology [label](sec:shared)
* shared prefixes between nouns and postpositions
* shared clitics (?) with verbs

The occurrence of bound [mp](u1) on members of all three parts of speech is illustrated in [exref](1marking); [exref](2marking) illustrates the same distribution for [mp](me2).

### Diachronic background
* all forms are "set II"
* almost all set II were phased out
* use of linker and complementary distribution are not the same thing
* other languages with set II main clauses:
    * Werikyana:
        * no linking behavior or morphology in Sa & Sp progressives
            * co-occurrence of nouns and Set II
            * _w-_ in nominalized Sa verbs, but not the progressive
        * linking behavior & morphology in transitive progressives 
    * Proto-Pemongan:
        * linking behavior in intransitives, with \*_i-w-_ becoming \*_ij-_
            * no linker present? hard to tell because of collapse of split-S
        * linking behavior in transitives, reconstruction of \*y- unclear (third person \*y- AND linker \*y-?)
    * Panare:
        * linking behavior in Sa verbs, _w-_
        * linking behavior and morphology in Sp verbs
        * linking behavior and morphology in transitive verbs
* transitive verbs:
    * behavior, but formal destabilization in V-initial forms in Pemongan
    * behavior & morphology in Panare
    * behavior & morphology in Werikyana
    * -> behavior & morphology expected
    * [lg](yab):          
        * linking morphology present but has fused with stem
        * no consistent linking behavior -> loss of VP
        * but: innovative proclitics
        * these triggered the linker at some point
        * but now they are just prefixes?
        * panare: innovative first person (gone the full cycle), conservative second person (no stress shift)
        * werikyana: linker is gone for 1/2 prefixes
        

* intransitive verbs:
    * complete loss of behavior & material in Werikyana
        * trace of _w-_ only with non-third persons...
    * linking behavior in Pemongan, but no sign of a linker (breakdown of split-S)
    * linking behavior and morphology in Panare
        * Sa verbs have _w-_ instead
    * not sure what to expect?



There are person indices shared between verbs one the one, and nouns and postpositions on the other hand:

* [mp](u1)
* [mp](me2)
* ([mp](ej12))

[mp](ta-3) is only found in verbs, while [mp](i3) and [mp](ylk) are only found on nouns and postpositions.
All shared morphemes are fairly recent innovations; all original inflectional morphology on verbs has disappeared.
Person prefixes have been replaced, while the linker [mp](ylk?nt), formerly also present on transitive verbs, was reanalyzed as part of the verb stem.
Even within this shared set, nouns and postpositions behave differently from verbs.

## Derivation and productivity
* changing word classes
* semantic variation & non-compositional meanings
* productive class-changing process w/ lexically conditioned suffixes
* some constructions need a different word class, no meaning change per se
