# Parts of speech in Yawarana [label](POS)

## Distinguishing parts of speech

### Adverbs
* copredicative function
* no person inflection
* deriving aderbs: [mp](keprop) [todo](is -ke negated with -jra only when on noun roots?)

### Postpositions
* [src](koehn1986apalai[111]) on Apala√≠: "Particles follow words of any class other than the ideophone, and never occur as free forms or in isolation."

## Shared morphology
* shared prefixes between nouns and postpositions
* shared clitics (?) with verbs

There are person indices shared between verbs one the one, and nouns and postpositions on the other hand:

* [mp](u1)
* [mp](me2)
* ([mp](ej12))

[mp](ta-3) is only found in verbs, while [mp](i3) and [mp](ylk) are only found on nouns and postpositions.
All shared morphemes are fairly recent innovations; all original inflectional morphology on verbs has disappeared.
Person prefixes have been replaced, while the linker [mp](ylk?nt), formerly also present on transitive verbs, was reanalyzed as part of the verb stem.
Even within this shared set, nouns and postpositions behave differently from verbs.

## Derivation and productivity
* changing word classes
* semantic variation & non-compositional meanings
* productive class-changing process w/ lexically conditioned suffixes
* some constructions need a different word class, no meaning change per se
