# Negation [label](negation)
There are a number of negation strategies in [lg](yab).
The most general negator is the particle =[mp](jra-neg), which can negate a number of constructions.
It occurs encliticized to transitive and intransitive verbs [exref](jra?suffix=a-b), nouns [exref](ctovarmafl-36), adverbs [exref](convestsjm-35) , and postpositions [exref](convhistfamsjm-244).
[ex](histyarirdi-124,convfemgrme-183,ctovarmafl-36,convestsjm-35,convhistfamsjm-244?example_id=jra)

On verbs, it sometimes occurs with an overt allomorph of [mp](riipfv) [exref](convfemgrme-183), sometimes its zero allomorph, shown in [exref](convrisamaj-24).
[ex](convrisamaj-24)
This variation is found in other contexts as well, but the conditioning factors of the deletion are currently unknown (see [ref](sec:riipfv)).
However, in the case of [mp](jra-neg), it may occur for a different reason entirely.
Historically, a verb suffixed with *\*-rï* and followed by a particle *\*pïra* was a distinct construction from a verb with an adverbializing negative suffix *\*-pïra* and followed by a copula [psrc](gildea2016negation,caceres2016negation).

## Verbal negation

* very rare
* etymology unknown
