# Negation [label](negation)

There are a number of negation strategies in [lg](yab).
The most general negator is the particle [mp](jra-neg), which can negate a number of constructions.
It occurs cliticized to transitive and intransitive verbs [exref](jra?suffix=a-b), nouns [exref](ctovarmafl-36), adverbs [exref](convestsjm-35) , and postpositions [exref](convhistfamsjm-244).

[ex](histyarirdi-124,convfemgrme-183,ctovarmafl-36,convestsjm-35,convhistfamsjm-244?example_id=jra)

On verbs, it sometimes occurs with an overt allomorph of [mp](riipfv) [exref](convfemgrme-183), sometimes with what is currently glossed as its zero allomorph [exref](convrisamaj-24).

[ex](convrisamaj-24)

The conditioning factors of said zero allomorph are currently unknown ([ref](sec:riipfv)).
In the specific case of [mp](jra-neg), another hypothesis imposes itself: historically, a verb with *\*-rï* and *\*pïra* was a distinct construction from a verb with bare *\*-pïra* plus copula [psrc](gildea2016negation).
One was a negation strategy with an adverbialized verb, the other a negative existential construction with a nominalized verb.
