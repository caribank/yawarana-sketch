## Pronouns [label](sec:pronouns)
The personal pronouns of [lg](yab) are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns).
It shows the usual Cariban inclusive/exclusive ([gl](1+2) and [gl](1+3)) distinction. [todo](is the 1+2 form cognate with apina? do we know something about its etymology?)
Note that the plural marker [mp](kontomopl) appears to usually be restricted to verbs, while *-santomo* is found with third person pronouns and demonstratives.

[table](pronouns)

Short forms of the first and second person pronouns can occur as proclitics attaching to nouns to indicate possessor ([ref](sec:nominalperson)), attached to verbs to indicate subject or object (described in [ref](verbinfl)), or attached to postpositions to indicate object of the postposition (described in [ref](sec:postinfl)):

[ex](convrisamaj-28)

An open question is whether [mp](t3) on verbs is a reduction of [mp](tewi-3pro). [todo](or is there a clear yes/no answer?)

The third person demonstrative pronouns or articles are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns3).
[todo](is there a 4‑way distinction? [cf. Ye’kwana?])

[table](pronouns3)

None of the demonstrative pronouns have shortened, phonologically bound counterparts.

* Nominal Interrogative pronouns:
    * [mp](aniki-who) 'who?'
    * [mp](ati-what) 'what?'
    * _ëjkë_ 'which? inan'
[todo](No plural forms for any of these?)


## Nominal inflection [label](sec:nouninfl)

Nouns in Yawarana may bear suffixes for possession ([ref](sec:nounposssuf)) and number ([ref](sec:nominalnumber)), and possessed nouns may bear a third person prefix, indexing a third person possessor, or a first or second proclitic (a reduced form of the free pronoun), indexing a first or second person possessor ([ref](sec:nominalperson)). 

### Suffixes for possessed and non-possessed nouns [label](sec:nounposssuf)

In the possession construction in Yawarana, the possessor noun occurs immediately preceding the possessed noun, which is the head of the possession phrase. Alternatively, the possessor can appear as a bound pronominal clitic (first & second person) or a prefix (third person) on the possessed noun. The possessor noun is never marked (for instance, with genitive case), but the possessed noun (the head) is often marked by a lexically specified ‘possessed’ suffix, either [mp](rupert) '[gl](pert)' or [mp](tipert) ‘pos’. Unpossessed nouns generally are unmarked, but some 15 nouns bear the suffix [mp](tenpert) ‘[gl](npert)’ when they appear without a possessor. 
Examples [exref](onlypossessed?end=unsuffixednouns) illustrate the possible patterns of markedness for nouns when possessed and unpossessed. In the first category, which contains the vast majority of nouns in our corpus, the unpossessed noun is unmarked, but when possessed the suffix -ri ‘pos’ occurs [exref](onlypossessed). A handful of nouns is marked with -ri/-ti ‘pos’ when possessed and with -të ‘npos’ when not possessed [exref](diffpossessed). Another handful is unmarked when possessed and marked with -të when not possessed [exref](suffunpossessed). The fourth logical possibility, in which the noun bears no marker of possession (or non-possession) whether possessed or unpossessed, contains very few members (only one attested so far); in this case, the difference is marked only by the presence or absence of a possessive prefix or free-form possessor [exref](unsuffixednouns). 

[todo](where did these come from? elicitation? is there a record?)

### Number suffixes [label](sec:nominalnumber)
There are two plural suffixes that can occur on nouns, apparently freely interchangeable.
What conditions the choice of suffix is not clear as of yet.

### Argument prefixes [label](sec:nominalperson)
Person prefixes on nouns are conditioned by the initial segment ([ref](tab:possprefixes)).
C-initial nouns take third person [m](i31), and first and second person are bare [m](u1) and [m](me2).
On V-initial nouns, third person is marked by [m](it3), and first and second person combine with the linker [mp](ylk).
Some examples are shown in [exref](ctorat-23?end=lastex).

[ex](convrisamaj-28)

[ex](desccasmaj-025)

[ex](ctorat-46)

[ex](ctorat-19?example_id=lastex)


The linker also occurs with (pro-)nominal possessors:

[ex](desccasmaj-131)

There are some nouns (kinship terms?) that take an apparently older old second person [mp](a2) ([ref](tab:oldpossprefixes)).

#### irregularly inflected nouns:

* 'father':
    * 1 *papa*
    * 2 _ëmë_ / _omo_ / _ëmo_ (?)
    * 3 _imu_
    * NP _yïmï_
