## Basic morphological template [label](sec:verb-template)

The following table shows the morpological template of [lg](yab) verbs, i.e. the order in which bound morphemes can occur within a vebral word form.

[table](verb_templ)

The first slot contains personal prefixes.
The relative order of three tense-aspect-mood suffixes can be seen in the following example:

[ex](ctorat-40)

More data is needed to firmly establish the relative order of all suffixes.

## Person

[ex](convrisamaj-28)


[ex](desccasmaj-008)


[ex](anfoperso-26)


## Aspect

### The pluractional marker [mp](petiplur). 
This aspect-marking morpheme is known from other Cariban languages [psrc](mattiola2020pluractional).
This example illustrates its [m](plur2) allomorph:

[ex](ctorat-40?withLanguage=False)

[txt](CtoRat)
And this example illustrates its [m](plur1) allomorph:

[ex](ctorat-32)

[lg](yab)

## Tense
### [mp](jpepst)
[mp](jpepst) is etymologically a nominalizer, but now it also functions as a simple past marker:

[ex](anfoperso-02)

It also occurs on nouns:

[ex](anfoperso-17)

### The supine
The suffix [mp](septcp) can be used to express a co-called supine meaning, i.e., purpose of motion.
Intransitive verbs occur unprefixed, while transitive verbs can carry person prefixes.

[ex](ctorat-03)
