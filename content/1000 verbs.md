## Basic morphological template {#sec:verb-template}

The following table shows the morpological template of [lg](yab) verbs, i.e. the order in which bound morphemes can occur within a vebral word form.

[table](verb_templ)

The first slot contains personal prefixes.
The relative order of three tense-aspect-mood suffixes can be seen in the following example:

[ex](ctorat-40)

More data is needed to firmly establish the relative order of all suffixes.


## The pluractional marker [mp](petiplur). 
This aspect-marking morpheme is known from other Cariban languages [psrc](mattiola2020pluractional).
This example illustrates its [m](plur2) allomorph:

[ex](ctorat-40)

## [mp](jpepst)
[mp](jpepst) is etymologically a nominalizer, but now it also functions as a simple past marker:

[ex](anfoperso-02)

It also occurs on nouns:

[ex](anfoperso-17)
