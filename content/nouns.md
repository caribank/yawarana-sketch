## Pronouns [label](sec:pronouns)
The personal pronouns of [lg](yab) are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns).
The system shows the usual Cariban inclusive/exclusive ([gl](1+2) and [gl](1+3)) distinction, although [mp](ejne-1-2pro) does not have the /k/ found elsewhere in the family.
Note that [mp](kontomopl) appears to usually be restricted to verbs, while *-santomo* is found with third person pronouns and demonstratives.

[table](pronouns)

[todo](tajne, but not attested as an article)

Reduced forms of the first and second person pronouns occur as proclitics [todo](proclitics or prefixes?) attaching to nouns to indicate possessor ([ref](sec:nominalperson)), attached to verbs to indicate subject or object (described in [ref](verbinfl)), or attached to postpositions to indicate the object of the postposition (described in [ref](sec:postinfl)):

[ex](convrisamaj-28)

[ex](desccasmaj-25)

[ex](convrisamaj-2)
[ex](ctoaragrme-7)

The third person demonstrative pronouns or articles are shown in [ref](tab:pronouns3).
[todo](is there a 4‑way distinction? [cf. Ye’kwana?])
None of them have shortened, phonologically bound counterparts.

* nominal interrogative pronouns:
    * [mp](aniki-who) (with _-santomo_)
    * [mp](ati-what) (no plural)
    * _ëjkë_ 'which? ([gl](inan))'

[todo](Are there plural forms of any of these?)


## Nominal inflection [label](sec:nouninfl)

Nouns in Yawarana may bear suffixes marking their possession status ([ref](sec:nounposssuf)), number ([ref](sec:nominalnumber)), and nominal past tense ([ref](sec:nominaltense)).
Possessed nouns may bear a person prefix, or the linker [mp](ylk?nt) ([ref](sec:nominalperson)). 

[todo](noun classes re: possession)


### Suffixes for possessed and non-possessed nouns [label](sec:nounposssuf)

In the possession construction in Yawarana, the possessor noun occurs immediately preceding the possessed noun, which is the head of the possession phrase. [todo](crossref to phrase structure)
Alternatively, the possessor can appear as a prefix on the possessed noun.
The possessor noun is never marked (for instance, with genitive case), but the possessed noun (the head) is often marked for being possessed by a suffix; an unambiguous label for this counterpart of the genitive is pertensive [psrc](dixon2010basic).
The choice of suffix is lexically conditioned; while most nouns take [mp](rupert), some take [mp](tipert?nt).
Unpossessed nouns generally are unmarked, but some 15 nouns [todo](which? list nouns) bear the suffix [mp](tenpert) when they appear without a possessor. 

Examples [exref](onlypossessed?end=unsuffixednouns) illustrate the possible patterns of markedness for nouns when possessed and unpossessed.
The vast majority of nouns in our corpus are unmarked when unpossessed, but when possessed the suffix [mp](rupert) occurs [exref](onlypossessed).
A handful of nouns [todo](i.e., the 15?) is marked with [mp](rupert?nt)/[mp](tipert) when possessed and with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](diffpossessed).
Another handful is unmarked when possessed and marked with [mp](tenpert) when not possessed [exref](suffunpossessed).
The fourth logical category, where neither possession or non-possession is marked, contains very few members (only one attested so far).
For these nouns, the difference is marked only by the presence or absence of a possessive prefix or free-form possessor [exref](unsuffixednouns).

### Number suffixes [label](sec:nominalnumber)
There are three plural suffixes that can occur on nouns, apparently freely interchangeable.
What conditions the choice of suffix is not clear as of yet.

* _-kontomo_

[ex](ctorat-17)

[ex](ctorat-40)


### Nominal tense [label](sec:nominaltense)

* [mp](jpepst)

### Argument prefixes [label](sec:nominalperson)
Person prefixes on nouns are conditioned by the initial segment ([ref](tab:possprefixes)).
C-initial nouns take [m](i31), and first and second person are bare [m](u1) and [m](me2).
On V-initial nouns, third person is marked with [m](it3), and the first and second person prefixes combine with the linker [mp](ylk?nt).
Some examples are shown in [exref](convrisamaj-28?end=lastex).

[table](possprefixes)

[ex](convrisamaj-28)

[ex](ctorat-46)

[ex](ctorat-19?example_id=lastex)

The linker also occurs with (pro-)nominal possessors:

[ex](desccasmaj-131)

There are some nouns [todo](presumably kinship terms) that take an apparently older old second person [mp](a2) ([ref](tab:oldpossprefixes)).

### Root suppletion in nominal possession [label](sec:irregnouns)

* 'father':
    * 1 *papa*
    * 2 _ëmë_ / _omo_ / _ëmo_ (?)
    * 3 _imu_
    * NP _yïmï_

candidates:

* 'arrow'
* 'house'
* 'poop'
* 'mother'
* 'hammock string'
