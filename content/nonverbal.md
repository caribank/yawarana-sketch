# Nonverbal predications [label](nonverbal)

[src](gildea2018reconstructing[366]) distinguishes two main formal types of nonverbal predication in Cariban languages: juxtaposition and copular constructions.

* juxtaposed NP + ADV or NP + LOC is found in Arara, Ikpeng, Ye'kwana, Wayana, and Apalaí
* for PC:
    * Nsubj + Npred: nominal (juxtaposition) predication. Limited in functional domains.
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Adverbial (adverbs/postpositional phrases). Fairly unlimited.
* Innovations:
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Npred (S&M 2009)
    * Nsubj + Adverbial

## Observations

### Patterns
* "existential particles" (*mëtë*, *mïntë*, *entë*, *ijtë*)
    * appear to be obligatory in the affirmative existential function, optional when negated
    * also occur in locative function [exref](loc-main-aff-part-nsubj)
    * also combine with postpositional locatives [exref](convfemgrme-99)
* the copula...
    * almost always occurs with adverbs (counterexample: [exref](perm-main-q-advpred-nsubj))
        * not when negated [exref](temp-main-neg-nsubj-advpred-jra)
    * can occur with locatives and existential particles
        * fairly solid pattern of copula serving as a location for past marking existential function: [exref](ex-main-aff-part-cop-nsubj), compare to [exref](ex-main-aff-part-nsubj)
        * however, no such pattern with locatives: copula [exref](loc-main-aff-part-cop-nsubj) and no copula [exref](loc-main-aff-part-nsubj) show no salient distribution
    * almost never occurs with nouns
        * only counterexample: [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> [gl](cop) with 'sick' [exref](temp-main-q-npred-cop); can occur without [gl](cop), too [exref](temp-main-aff-npred-cop)
    * does not combine with [mp](pirare-nothing)
        * one counterexample with [gl](part)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> + [mp](pirare-nothing?nt) + [gl](cop) + [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> is with a concessive [exref](ex-main-neg-part-pirare-cop-nsubj) [todo](@spike: I forgot, what was your analysis for this particular example?)
        * it does occur with [mp](pinire-nothing), though [exref](loc-main-neg-nsubj-cop-pinire-part)
    * is always present in subordinate clauses (*chi-yawë* 'when', *chi-pëke* 'because') [todo](@spike: would you analyze these subordinate clauses as having a copula? if  yes, that would constitute a small but solid difference between main and subordinate clauses, right?)
        * even with nominal predicates: [exref](cat-sub-aff-npred-nsubj-cop), [exref](temp-sub-aff-npred-nsubj-cop)
        * one example of negation, occurs on additional copula [exref](loc-sub-neg-locpred-cop-neg-nsubj)
        * one example of *chi chipokono* [exref](convamgu-101)
* several negation strategies:
    * [mp](jraneg) for adverbs and on nouns in the existential *pïrarë* [gl](np~subj~)*-jra* construction [exref](ex-main-neg-pirare-nsubj-jra)
    * [mp](pinire-nothing) for nominal predicates and ones with locative particles
    * [mp](pirare-nothing) for existential predicates
        * also for identification [exref](id-main-neg-npred-pirare)
        * so far no example of simple *pïrarë* [gl](np~subj~)
    * *-ja* or *-jnari* on the copula
* order is fairly flexible; potentially rigid \[ADVpred (Nsubj) COP\] 
[todo](continue here)

### Open questions
* unclear role of [mp](maniki-rel-anim) in [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> + [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> construction
* is there a pattern as to whether existential/locative particles combine with the copula?

* [todo](@spike: how would you classify 'yo estaba sola'?)

[ex](descmensgrme-41)

[todo](can't interpret this even with context)

[ex](convamgu-297)

### Categorization issues
* possessives vs properties can be hard to distinguish ('footed', etc.)
* existential particles in existentials and locatives: largely went by 'estar' vs 'haber' in translation, with the exception of [exref](convcosnoind-48)
* weird "adverbial subject"? [exref](poss-main-neg-advsubj-pirare-locpred)
* construction with two copulas *chi wejsapë*? [exref](convhistfamsjm-92), [exref](convhistfamsjm-59), [exref](histgrme-17), [exref](histgrme-107)
