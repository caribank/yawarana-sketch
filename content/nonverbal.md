# Nonverbal predications [label](nonverbal)

[src](gildea2018reconstructing[366]) distinguishes two main formal types of nonverbal predication in Cariban languages: juxtaposition and copular constructions.

* juxtaposed NP + ADV or NP + LOC is found in Arara, Ikpeng, Ye'kwana, Wayana, and Apalaí
* for PC:
    * Nsubj + Npred: nominal (juxtaposition) predication. Limited in functional domains.
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Adverbial (adverbs/postpositional phrases). Fairly unlimited.
* Innovations:
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Npred (S&M 2009)
    * Nsubj + Adverbial
* Take functional approach, go through kinds of NVP & find constructions
    * Negation
    * Interrogation
* What are particles doing?
* What is word order doing?


**First impressions:**

* Order in N + N is variable -- tendency to place demonstrative subjects at end?
* No copula with nominal or locative predicates, only adverbial ones?
* negation [mp](jraneg) for adverbial, [mp](pinire-nothing) for nominal predicates ([mp](pirare-nothing) for existentials)
* [mp](maniki-rel-anim) in N + N constructions

## Questions & issues
* how to analyze 'close to LOC' constructions? [wf](teijpo?translation=far) seems to be an adverb.
* possessives vs properties? ('footed', etc.)
* ex vs loc (largely went by translation)

* the one example of [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> [gl](cop) is with weird 'sick':
[ex](conv1stenc-99)

## Subordination
* [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> [gl](cop) only occurs with *chi-yawë* 'when'
* [gl](adv)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> ([gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub>) [gl](cop) with *chi-yawë* 'when' and *chi-pëkë* 'because'
