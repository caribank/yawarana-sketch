# Nonverbal predications [label](nonverbal)

[src](gildea2018reconstructing[366]) distinguishes two main formal types of nonverbal predication in Cariban languages: juxtaposition and copular constructions.

* juxtaposed NP + ADV or NP + LOC is found in Arara, Ikpeng, Ye'kwana, Wayana, and Apalaí
* for PC:
    * Nsubj + Npred: nominal (juxtaposition) predication. Limited in functional domains.
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Adverbial (adverbs/postpositional phrases). Fairly unlimited.
* Innovations:
    * Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Npred (S&M 2009)
    * Nsubj + Adverbial

## Observations

### Patterns
* copula almost always occurs with adverbs, fairly often with locatives and existential particles, the only tokens with nouns are edge cases
    * no copula with adverbs when negated [exref](temp-main-neg-nsubj-advpred-jra)
    * [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> [gl](cop) only with 'sick' (a noun?) [exref](temp-main-aff-npred-cop), [exref](temp-main-q-npred-cop)
    * [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> [gl](cop) only occurs with *chi-yawë* 'when' [exref](cat-sub-aff-npred-nsubj-cop), [exref](temp-sub-aff-npred-nsubj-cop) [todo](does the etymological presence of COP in this construction imply that it once had a copula?)
    * pattern for existential particles?
        * copula used to express tense in existential function? [exref](ex-main-aff-part-cop-nsubj) vs [exref](ex-main-aff-part-nsubj)
        * no such pattern with locatives... [exref](loc-main-aff-part-cop-nsubj) vs [exref](loc-main-aff-part-nsubj)
* copula does not combine with [mp](pirare-nothing)
    * one counterexample with [gl](part)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> + [mp](pirare-nothing?nt) + [gl](cop) + [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> is with a concessive [exref](ex-main-neg-part-pirare-cop-nsubj) -- copula required for marking?
    * it does occur with [mp](pinire-nothing), though [exref](loc-main-neg-nsubj-cop-pinire-part)
* negation:
    * [mp](jraneg) for adverbs and as privative (?) on nouns in existential predicates
    * [mp](pinire-nothing) for nominal predicates and ones with locative particles
    * [mp](pirare-nothing) for existential predicates
    * *-ja* or *-jnari* on the copula
* order is fairly flexible; potentially rigid \[ADVpred (Nsubj) COP\] 



### Open questions
* unclear role of [mp](maniki-rel-anim) in [gl](np)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> + [gl](np)<sub>[gl](subj)</sub> construction
* is there a pattern as to whether existential/locative particles combine with the copula?

### Categorization issues
* how to analyze 'close to [gl](loc)' constructions? [wf](teijpo?translation=far) seems to be an adverb.
* possessives vs properties? ('footed', etc.)
* existentials vs locatives both with *mëtë*/*mïntë*/*entë* (largely went by translation)
    * sometimes they co-occur [exref](convfemgrme-157), [exref](convfemgrme-99)
* one apparent example of [gl](adv)<sub>[gl](pred)</sub> without copula [exref](perm-main-q-advpred-nsubj)
* weird "adverbial subject"? [exref](poss-main-neg-advsubj-pirare-locpred)
* construction with two copulas *chi wejsapë*? [exref](convhistfamsjm-92), [exref](convhistfamsjm-59), [exref](histgrme-17), [exref](histgrme-107)
