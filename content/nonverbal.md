# Nonverbal predications [label](nonverbal)

[src](gildea2018reconstructing[366]) distinguishes two main formal types of nonverbal predication in Cariban languages: juxtaposition and copular constructions.

* juxtaposed NP + ADV or NP + LOC is found in Arara, Ikpeng, Ye'kwana, Wayana, and Apala√≠

Spike for PC:

* Nsubj + Npred: nominal (juxtaposition) predication. Limited in functional domains.
* Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Adverbial (adverbs/postpositional phrases). Fairly unlimited.

Innovations:

* Nsubj + [gl](cop) + Npred (S&M 2009)
* Nsubj + Adverbial

* Take functional approach, go through kinds of NVP & find constructions
    * Interrogation
    * Negation
* What are particles doing?
* What is word order doing?
