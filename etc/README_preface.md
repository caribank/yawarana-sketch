This README file was generated from the files in [contents/](contents); they use [cldfviz](https://github.com/cldf/cldfviz/) and some preprocessing to load data from [the corresponding CLDF dataset](https://github.com/fmatter/yaw_cldf).
There is also a [plaintext preview](preview.md) to be used during the writing process, and a [PDF version](latex_version/main.pdf), generated via LaTeX.
