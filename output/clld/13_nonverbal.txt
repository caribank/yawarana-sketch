Spike for PC:

* Nsubj + Npred: nominal (juxtaposition) predication. Limited in functional domains.
* Nsubj + <span class='smallcaps'>cop</span> + Adverbial (adverbs/postpositional phrases). Fairly unlimited.

Innovations:

* Nsubj + <span class='smallcaps'>cop</span> + Npred (S&M 2009)
* Nsubj + Adverbial

* Take functional approach, go through kinds of NVP & find constructions
    * Interrogation
    * Negation
* What are particles doing?
* What is word order doing?
