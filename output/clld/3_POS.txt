## Distinguishing parts of speech


* [koehn1986apalai](sources.bib?with_internal_ref_link&ref#cldf:koehn1986apalai): 111: "Particles follow words of any class other than the ideophone, and never occur as free forms or in isolation."

### Adverbs
* copredicative function
* no person inflection

## Shared morphology

## Derivation and productivity

* changing word classes
* semantic variation & non-compositional meanings
* productive class-changing process w/ lexically conditioned suffixes
* some constructions need a different word class, no meaning change per se
